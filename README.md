This project implemented the Cat and Grep text processing tools, which are often used in the Linux terminal.
# Short manual
The project is written for macOS on Ubuntu, some of the tests fail!   
Please upload the project to your PC before following these steps:  
| :--- |
| git clone https://github.com/DevPaBeL/SimpleBashUtils.git |

To launch the project, go to the folder Src/ then select the folder grep/ or cat/, type in the console for grep - make, for cat - make s21_cat, after building the project, you can run tests, type in the console sh test.sh for grep, or sh test.bash for cat.   
The tests compare the different behavior of the cat and grep I wrote with the handling of different flags, with the original cat and grep.
